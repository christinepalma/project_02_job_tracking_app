<H1>JOB SEARCH TRACKING APP</H1>

MVP-stage - An app that helps you to succeed in your job search. It will keep track of where you applied and the documents you submitted and who you contacted and the status of your application process with a particular company.

Phase two - a: It will keep a reminder calendar that will have email alerts, such as when you have an interview scheduled or need to mail out a thank you card after the interview or email a follow up letter. 

Phase three - Some sort of book marklett or ability to grab information off a job search page, such as job title and job description. Maybe API to popular job boards.

Phase four - It would be cool if it could do a mock interview with you so that you can role play and prepare ahead of your job interview.
